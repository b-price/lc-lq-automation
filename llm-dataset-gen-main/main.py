Language Construct (LC) represents the linguistic construction of a symbol-concept relationship that can be observed during the language development process. LC Codings may contain concepts (CO) and symbols (SY). {definitions['concept']} {definitions['symbol']} The LC Codings are represented by the 'SY1, SY2, CO1, and CO2' columns in the dataset. If the generated data does not have 2 symbols and 2 concepts, leave the entry empty. The dataset contains 4 types of language quality issues: incompleteness (INC), meaningless (MLN), redundancy (RDC), and ambiguity (AMB). For the generated data, ensure the Language Quality (LQ Code) is 'redundancy'. {definitions['redundancy']} Ensure each generated Excerpt is unique."
